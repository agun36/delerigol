                  Technology is known to be an enabler for driving every aspect
                  of businesses or sectors. To ensure organisations derive
                  maximum value for money for their technology investment, it is
                  important for organisations to evaluate and /or strategise on
                  how and what to invest in technology to drive their business.

                  Design Sprint is a proven, repeatable process for rapidly
                  solving big challenges, creating new products or services, or
                  improving existing ones. It compresses months of work into
                  just a few days. At Rongil, we facilitate design sprint to
                  help you create new service or product idea quickly and
                  effectively so you can focus on giving your customers what
                  they truly want. Our consultants are trained by MIT, Columbia
                  Business School and Dartmouthâ€™s Tuck School of Business. From
                  mapping, sketching, and deciding, to prototyping and testing,
                  your organisation will learn to master each step of Design
                  Sprint by actually doing it. You will build muscle memory for
                  facilitating your own sprints (whether it is their 1st or
                  101st) and for incorporating these techniques into problem
                  solving, product development, and day-to-day operations. For
                  each sprint, we take you through three broad phases that
                  centre on people, technology and your business: Real, worth,

                  We work with the public sector through our GovTech Innovation
                  Lab Program to innovate new projects that can be driven with
                  technology to deliver more efficient and effective government
                  services and/or products to citizens, businesses, external
                  stakeholders and other government institutions. We leverage on
                  our wealth of experience and understanding of the public
                  sector to work with the client to hack existing problems,
                  analyse public sector value chain, elicit stakeholder
                  expectations and domesticate new solutions that can be scaled
                  across wider geographical spread of the country. We have
                  executed this type of service for some federal government
                  institutions in helping them to shape annual projects.
